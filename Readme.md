# Galactic Cargo Management System Using AVL Tree

The **Galactic Cargo Management System (GCMS)** is a highly optimized and sophisticated interstellar cargo management framework leveraging AVL Tree data structures for hyper-efficient resource allocation. This avant-garde system is tailored for galaxy-wide logistical operations, ensuring maximum optimization of bin capacity and adherence to specialized handling requirements based on dynamically categorized cargo types.

## Abstract

Intergalactic commerce demands robust algorithms to ensure the seamless packing and deployment of cargo across vast spatial distances. The GCMS employs a rigorous bin-packing paradigm, orchestrated through AVL Tree balancing, to mitigate inefficiencies in cargo placement and expedite transit operations. Each cargo item is classified under a stringent color-coded scheme that dictates bin selection algorithms designed to minimize space wastage and maximize the structural integrity of the load.

### System Overview

The GCMS bifurcates the bin-packing strategy into two core algorithms, each meticulously curated to address unique cargo properties:

1. **Compact Fit Algorithm**:
   - A deterministic approach favoring minimal spatial inefficiency, this algorithm strategically places objects into bins with the smallest viable remaining capacity. This operation mandates precision to avert overflow, and in scenarios with equivalent capacities, bin prioritization is enforced based on unique ID hierarchies (ascending or descending).

2. **Largest Fit Algorithm**:
   - Optimized for cargo requiring enhanced spatial buffering, this algorithm prioritizes bins with maximal capacity availability. Its operational complexity necessitates real-time AVL Tree recalibration to maintain equilibrium and ensure logarithmic efficiency. When bin capacities match, object placement is further refined based on a rigorous ID evaluation criterion.

### AVL Tree Integration

To circumvent the pitfalls of linear search inefficiencies, the GCMS incorporates AVL Tree data structures, a self-balancing binary search tree variant. This strategic integration ensures that all bin operations—such as insertion, deletion, and search—adhere to logarithmic time complexity. The AVL Tree's automatic rebalancing mechanism is pivotal for maintaining system scalability, especially under high-load scenarios characteristic of interstellar cargo management.

- **Height-Balanced Operations**: By maintaining a strict balance factor criterion, the AVL Tree optimizes node height disparities, thereby ensuring equilibrium.
- **Rotational Mechanics**: The system employs advanced single and double rotation techniques to rectify balance violations post-update operations, preserving the integrity of the tree structure.

### Color-Coded Cargo Handling

Cargo items are uniquely distinguished by color, each requiring algorithmic discretion based on handling prerequisites:

- **Blue Cargo**: Utilizes the Compact Fit Algorithm with a preference for bins of the smallest ID.
- **Yellow Cargo**: Applies the Compact Fit Algorithm, but prioritizes bins with the largest ID.
- **Red Cargo**: Engages the Largest Fit Algorithm, targeting bins with maximal capacity while favoring the smallest ID.
- **Green Cargo**: Leverages the Largest Fit Algorithm, with a predisposition toward bins with the largest ID.

### Theoretical Complexity

The GCMS architecture is meticulously designed to operate within stringent computational constraints:

- **Temporal Complexity**: Achieves **O(log n + log m)** performance for key operations, with an extended complexity of **O(log n + S)** for bin querying functions, where `S` represents the number of objects in the queried bin.
- **Spatial Efficiency**: Adheres to a space complexity model of **O(n + m)**, ensuring optimal memory utilization even under extensive operational loads.
